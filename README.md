# RouteOptimizationAPI
RouteOptimizationAPI is a C++ library designed to compute optimal routes from a starting location to multiple destinations while optimizing for fastest and/or cheapest routes. The library will integrate with TomTom API to fetch real-time distances and provide smart route-planning capabilities. This library is built to be modular and cross-platform.
